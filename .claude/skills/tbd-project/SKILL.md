# TBD Project Guide

TBD is a macOS native app for managing git worktrees and terminals in multi-agent Claude Code workflows. Three components: a daemon (`tbdd`), a CLI (`tbd`), and a SwiftUI app (`TBDApp`).

## Architecture

The daemon owns all state. The CLI and app are both clients that talk to the daemon via a Unix socket.

```

## Key Conventions

### SPM Package Structure

Four targets in one package — `TBDShared` (library), `TBDDaemonLib` (library), `TBDDaemon` (executable, just main.swift), `TBDCLI` (executable), `TBDApp` (executable). Tests import `TBDDaemonLib`, not `TBDDaemon`.

The `TBDDaemon` and `TBDDaemonLib` targets share `Sources/TBDDaemon/` — `TBDDaemonLib` excludes `main.swift`, `TBDDaemon` only includes `main.swift` and excludes all subdirectories.

### RPC Protocol

JSON over Unix socket. `RPCRequest` has `method: String` and `params: String` (raw JSON). `RPCResponse` has `success: Bool`, `result: String?` (raw JSON), `error: String?`. Each param/result struct is independently Codable. The router decodes params based on the method string.

### Tmux Integration

Uses **grouped sessions** — NOT control mode. Each terminal panel creates a grouped session (`tmux new-session -t main -s view-<uuid>`) and attaches via a native PTY. SwiftTerm connects directly. For rationale and details: consult `references/architecture.md` or `docs/tmux-integration.md`.

### Git Operations

All git commands use `Process.arguments` arrays — never shell string interpolation (prevents command injection). GitManager methods are async, using `terminationHandler` with `CheckedContinuation`.

### Hooks

Resolution order (first match wins, no chaining): app per-repo config → conductor.json → .dmux-hooks → global default. This avoids double-execution when dmux hooks call conductor scripts internally.

### Testing

Tests use Swift Testing framework (`import Testing`, `@Test`, `#expect`), not XCTest. Import `TBDDaemonLib` for daemon tests. Database tests use in-memory `DatabaseQueue`.

### Adding New RPC Methods

1. Add method constant to `RPCMethod` in `Sources/TBDShared/RPCProtocol.swift`
2. Add param/result structs in the same file
3. Add handler in `Sources/TBDDaemon/Server/RPCRouter.swift`
4. Add client method in `Sources/TBDApp/DaemonClient.swift`
5. Add CLI command in `Sources/TBDCLI/Commands/`
6. Broadcast state delta if mutation

### Worktree Names

Auto-generated as `YYYYMMDD-adjective-animal` from curated word lists (sourced from unique-names-generator). Branch: `tbd/<name>`. Path: `<repo>/.tbd/worktrees/<name>/`.

## Common Tasks

### Restart for testing
```bash
scripts/restart.sh          # rebuild + restart (~2s)
scripts/restart.sh --app    # app only
scripts/restart.sh --quick  # skip build
```

### Debug terminal rendering
Check `/tmp/tbd-bridge.log` for tmux bridge diagnostics.
